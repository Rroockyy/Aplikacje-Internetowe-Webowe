# Why is this repository

It's nothing much to look into, just files from school.

# Contents? 

Well, "*Internetowe*" are the files that are mostly from inf.03 qualification exams and "*Webowe*" are files from lessons mostly about JS.
I'll also throw in some of the inf.03 exams that i did myself as a test.
